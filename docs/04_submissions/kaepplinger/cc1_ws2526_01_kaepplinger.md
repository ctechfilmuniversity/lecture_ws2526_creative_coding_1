*Answer*: Just time to adapt to new learnings


## Task 01.02

Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session? 

*Answer*: I would be intereseted in developing Pipeline tools but I'm not sure about the final creative coding project yet.

## Task 01.03

Creative coding project that I like: 

*Answer*: While searching for creative coding examples, I found Shadertoy and a project called Bumped Sinusoidal Warp, which uses GLSL shader code to generate a dynamic, metallic-looking surface entirely in real time. I like this project because the visuals are created purely through mathematical algorithms and GPU programming, showing how code itself can be used as a powerful visual and artistic medium.

## Learnings

*While I struggled with ideas on the 10Print Pattern I had a straigh forward idea here, the main layout was quiet easy to do, the rest was a bit of a challange.
For the Snow i used a Tutorial from "TheCodingTrain".
For the check if all 3 items are the same Ii used AI but i marked it in the code where I used it. I just couldnt get it to work, that it checks which parts are scrubbed off.
I was unsure how to make the reset Button work so that took a lot of time and decided to do a combination of JS and CSS to make it work.
Sadly I moved through this project with a lot of time pressure, so i couldn't really keep that much of what i learned..
Other than that I still learned a lot of keeping the code clean, how the preload function works and how to check and work with the mouse Input*
