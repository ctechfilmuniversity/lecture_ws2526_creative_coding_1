### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices

- **What have you used and how has it served you?**  
I use ChatGPT mainly for quick idea iteration and to reflect on concepts. For all of these lessons, I try to avoid using it for the actual coding part. I only rely on it when something completely breaks and I cannot solve it on my own, mainly for debugging. This makes the process much much slower, and sometimes I am not fully satisfied with the results, but it forces me to really engage with the material.
I also use ChatGPT to review my written scripts, check my grammar, and improve sentence structure.

- **Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you?**  
Since I mostly avoid relying on generated code for the core parts, I understand most of what I write because I developed it step by step myself. When I do use ChatGPT for debugging, I go through the suggestions carefully and make sure I understand why they work before applying them. Of course, there are some parts that I just can’t wrap my head around, and I use ML tools for those when I get overly frustrated.

- **Would you be able to re-create it without any help?**  
Yes, at least conceptually. Because I worked through most of the implementation on my own, I feel confident that I could rebuild the main systems again. It would take time, but the understanding is much deeper than if I had depended heavily on generated solutions. I think I definetly need more side projects in order to have a better understanding of what is going on. In the end it is a language, that I need to learn.

- **What can you recommend?**  
ML tools are very helpful, but especially in a learning environment, they should support—not replace—independent thinking. Working through problems yourself, even if the outcome is slower and less polished, leads to stronger long-term understanding.

- **How do you want to proceed?**  
I will continue using ChatGPT mainly as a support tool for brainstorming, debugging when necessary, and improving my writing. It is always tempting to rely on it more, especially when comparing my work to others. However, for these lessons I prefer a slower process with projects that might not look perfect, because I believe this approach will help me build a stronger foundation for the future.

## Learnings
In this homework project I learned to use the GLTF Loader to load glb Models into ThreeJS and add them to the scene.
I wanted to work on something more interactive so I learned to use Keyboard Inputs to move a 3D Character throught the scene.
Furthermore I added a mushroom Model and scattered it through out my scene with a for loop.
