## Learnings
For my starting journey I watched the first few Tutorials of ThreeJSJourney.
I learned how to create a 3D scene in Three.js including adding a directional Light, materials, and randomly scattered 3D objects. I also learned how to update the cameras location in runtime with simple Orbit Controls and to use Debugging Tools to Debug with lil GUI and how I can apply simple MatCap Textures to my 3D Models. It was a rough process to understand it without constantly looking up the documentation.
