## Task 05.01 - The Final Project

*Submission*: 

 > Description:
I built a music visualizer by adapting a morpgin sphere Tutorial from Bruno Simon’s Three.js Journey. This was my first time managing a project across multiple JS and GLSL files, a process that helped me understand good practices and code structure. To ensure the experience is fully immersive, I integrated a cross-browser full-screen toggle. 
Additionally, I avoided copyright issues by using music some of my friends made.

Side Note: By pressing the letter 'H' you can access some Debugging tools and play with the visuals a bit more. 

**IMPORTANT: If you are trying to access the site through a mobile device, please make sure it is not on silent mode, otherwise the music won't play!**

Enjoy!

> 3

- How much did you enjoy working with p5, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?
> 1

- How useful do you consider p5 for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?
> 1

- How much did you enjoy working with tree.js, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?

- What do you think about the context expansions, e.g., the brief general discussions of certain topics?
> Loved the discussions in class, but it was a bit hard to concentrate sometimes because of my sleep schedule. 

- Which one was your favorite topic, which one your least favorite?
> Three js has got to be my favourite one, since I can use it in the future for my website.

> least favorite: p5js -> good start into coding but I most likely will never use it again. 
Would prefer a start a dive into Python more.

- Was there a topic missing and if so which one?
> Pythoooon :D

- Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

> - Loved the classes, great discussions and Jonathan is really good at explaining things. Would love to have him again sometime. Ni

## Learnings

I wish I had more time for some of the exercises but I still want to dive deeper into ThreeJS. There is so much to discover.
In the 04 lesson I wrote that I am trying to avoud AI at all costs but here was a different story, since I didnt find much Tutorials I could build upon.
I felt pressured to use AI for troubleshooting and code cleanup because I had already significantly exceeded my original timeline. 
I realize now that I might have set the bar too high for myself by trying to do every single thing on my own.
I actually really enjoy the troubleshooting part but it takes away much needed time. 

Added later: On the final submission day I heavily relied on AI as i could not figure out why my audio didn't play back on smartphone devices.
I searched through several reddit forums and could not find a solution. While doing that I also added a preload function so the Audio Files already get loaded into a buffer when the user visits the site, so clicking arround the different genres feels more fluent.

Some things I learned:
- How to create Buttons and make a Fullscreen View
- How to create seperat js and glsl files that I can 
- Audio Reactive Shader with GLSL
- Using CSS HTML Elements inside 3D Space with CSS3D
- Using GSAP for smooth Camera Animations
- Vercel Deployment on my own.
- Uploading Audio Files and analying them to drive variables.

Problems I ran into:
- actually combining the Tutorial of ThreeJS Journey in my own style and 
- Audio Files that won't play on smaller devices like Smartphones.
- Converting .wav files to mp3 because they were too large.
- and maannnny more small bugs I came along during testing.

**Thank you!**
