# Session 04 - Asynchronism / Space Again (15 points)

Please complete this session by February 11th. Completing the session should take < 6h.

In this session we are dealing with the topic of _asynchronism_, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.

## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 04.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats. As a beginner you can skip the more advanced sections that we haven't covered in class:

- [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
- [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
- [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
- [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework.

If you are more advanced, make sure that your understand Closures, Promises and Async and Await.

### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices

Reflect on your usage of resources and Machine Learning tools for coding.

- What have you used and how has it served you?
- Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you (in case you have used any)?
- Would you be able to re-create it without any help?
- What can you recommend?
- How do you want to proceed?

*Submission:
used it in the beginning to directly look a specific lines of code or tell me about errors.

I moved on and let it help me make plans, integrate features and fix syntax, spacing and readability of code. I also let it recommend me some best practice code behavior which (like I stated in previous submissions) is smart but unintuitive for a beginner. 

I think I would be able to recreate some of my projects but it would take a lot more time, be less clean and have some bugs/ best practice behavior I didn’t consider.

For simple features like screen scaling and other aspects I usually let an AI give me the code that I just need to add. 

What I use (not in this example but in working for my final submission):
Gemini to create a project plan and split up tasks  Recommending Approaches and ChatGPT + Claude to fix/ inspect code and recommend different solutions. 

I Recommend: 

Only partially using AI for specific tasks. So you still understand your code

Let it help you break up problems and help you with individual pieces. 

Be careful. When I worked with an AI and gave it some of my code, I got a working version back but for me it was way less comprehensive. So sometimes when fixing your code the AI optimizes it to a point you lose control and can no longer work on it without the help of the AI.
(This has been partialy the case in this submission.)

## Three.js

### Task 04.03 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You are required to use additional functionality that you haven't yet used last week. Check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) or [the examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) for inspiration.

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

_Submission_: I feel like my takes on working with Machine Learning are a reflection of my learnings and struggles.
