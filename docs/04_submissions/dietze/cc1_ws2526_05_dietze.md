# Session 05 - Systems (55 points)

Please complete this session by February 28th. Completing the session should take < 40h.

- [Creative Coding I](#creative-coding-i)
- [Session 05 - Systems (55 points)](#session-05---systems-55-points)
  - [Task 05.01 - The Final Project](#task-0501---the-final-project)
  - [Task 05.02 - Feedback](#task-0502---feedback)
  - [Learnings](#learnings)

Our last topic is _systems_. We are done with the class and hopefully from here on you have enough coding competencies and algorithmic thinking developed that you can build more complex systems - by using code, nodes, hardware... Also, hopefully you, yourself, can further evolve with what you have learned from this class (🐛 -> 🦋).

## Task 05.01 - The Final Project

The final project is an individually chosen project.

_Maybe a portfolio page?_ 👑

_Maybe something useless?_ 😁

You can do whatever you want but your project must make use of text-based programming. It can also be an experiment, part of a larger project, work in progress, or a learning path. Ideally it should be something online, but this is not a hard requirement. You don't need to submit a project plan beforehand. However, I am open to discuss your plan with me in advance.

The time dedicated to the final project is ~40h.

The official work period for the final assignment is Feb. 1st - Feb. 28th. The deadline for the final project is February, 28th.

- The deadline for the final project is strict and for a late submission, I reduce **15% of the total points**.
- If you are sick within the official work period, you can get a deadline extension based on a doctor's note ("Attest"). You must hand in the Attest within 3 days.

As submission, I require

- a description
- the source code
- a link to the build / online deployment or such, and
- at least one representative image.

Submit your code in your assignment folder as assignment `05` or add a link there to where to find the code.

## Task 05.02 - Feedback

- How would you rate the difficulty of this class from 1 (far too easy) to 5 (far too difficult)?

    3

- How would you rate the amount of work you had to put into this class so far from 1 (no work at all) to 5 (far too much work)?

    4.5

- How much did you learn in the class and expanded your skill set, from 1 (I am the same) to 5 (learned a lot)?

    3

- How much did you enjoy working with p5, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?

    4

- How useful do you consider p5 for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?


    3

- How much did you enjoy working with tree.js, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?

    2.5

- How useful do you consider tree.js for you, from 1 (don't need it) to 5 (will use it all the time)?

    4

- How much did you enjoy working with React, from 1 (hate it) to 5 (love it)?

    3

1.  4
2.  5
3.  2

5.  4



- What do you think about the context expansions, e.g., the brief general discussions of certain topics?

    Very much usefull, but sometimes a´hard to comprehend in the limited timeframe we had. 

- Which one was your favorite topic, which one your least favorite?
- Was there a topic missing and if so which one?

I can really say if there was a topic missing. I can only say, if someone recommends a topic to cover it should replace another topic otherwise the information load becomes to much. 

- Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!

I would have liked to work on our submissions/ final project  more in class but I know that we didn’t have the time for that. So I wish we have had more time to explore the topics. :)

I want more and I want to get better is probably a very good indicator that your class was very good and left a positive impact.


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings of the final project and in regard to the whole course. What was challenging for you? How did you challenge yourself?

_Submission_: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.
