# Creative Coding I

Prof. Dr. Lena Gieseke \| l.gieseke@filmuniversitaet.de \| Film University Babelsberg KONRAD WOLF

# Session 02 - Instruction (10 points)



### Tools and Environments

Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of, that you can recommend, and which are not included in the script? _If not, you can skip this question._

_Submission_: None

## Instructions

Submit a text-based program and its result for each of the following instruction. Try to include into the programming some algorithmic thinking, meaning a structured approach.

_Note_: You are free to choose any programming language, environment, library, etc. for this task, but it must be text-based programming. If you are a beginner, I highly recommend that you stick with p5.

### Task 02.01 - _Coding_

> Circles!

> 
> Approach:

I first played with bouncing balls

Then I added two moveable pedals in the scene

and then I integrated the pong interaction, struggled with that

I looked up a tutorial and tried integrating a solution in my code


### Task 02.02 - _Coding_

> Happiness.

>
> Approach:

In this one I tired playing with different effects

After having a general idea I adjusted and just played with it

Because of the first task with circles  and then the pong idea I always tried to make it work ; and with this task I wanted to have something which is done and I can add to and play with

<!-- > When I see you, it makes me happy. -->

### Task 02.03 - _Algorithmic Thinking_

Briefly reflect on how you implemented your creative idea. Did you apply algorithmic thinking and if so, how?

_Submission_: 
Pong:

Built the program feature by feature

Balls spawning

Pedals moving

Pedals interacting with balls

Happy:

First created the basic face 

Then added animation 

Used arrays and a loop to manage multiple faces over time

Played around with features

Algorithmic thinking feels just like a way to break your problem down and is something I already did when working with Unity or TouchDesigner. I drew little boxes on paper and broke down steps, processes and parts I needed in a very comprehensive way. I.e. Functioning Theremin would be: Hand position request + Audio Modulation scrip → Fmod Audio: Headset Audio manager.

### Task 02.04 - _Creative Instructions_

Write instructions that are in themselves a creative output.

_Hint:_ This is not about instructions for a creative output but about thinking about the instructions themselves and how to shape them creatively.

_Submission_: Text and/or an audiovisual representation in your markdown submission file.
Air Hockey:
1. Grab a friend
2. Grab 2 pedals
3. Put coins in the machine
4. Push puck away when on your side
5. Celebrate when getting a goal
6. Scream “Awwww, man” when friend scores a goal
7. Inevitably lose because you aren’t good at air hockey
8. Get pizza after
9. Increases friendship level
10. Repeat until you win

    …

    97 . Win

    98 . No longer know what to do

    99 . System Error

## The Web

### Task 02.05 - _Working With a Local Server_

Create a setup with a local webserver and be able to work with, e.g., p5, locally.

A possible setup could simply be using a local webserver with [the VSCode extension](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#webservers).

If needed, re-cap the topic by reading [Example: A Local Setup For p5.js](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#example-a-local-setup-for-p5js).

Also, it is time to getting used to doing simple steps with the terminal (😱). For that, you can work through the chapter [Terminal / Console](..//02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#terminal--console) in the setup script.

No need to submit anything, but I expect that you are ready to work with a local webserver and the terminal from next week on.

_Submission_: 

This would be the perfect place to put a local link and show that it worked and in the same motion demonstrate a total lack of understanding. :)

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

_Submission_:

A personal learning for me was to use AI in planning and mid stages. Letting ChatGPT break down a problem and my approaches and telling me about different functions/ ways to build up a prototype was a huge improvement for my workflow.

Sending my program and asking Chat-GPT to format it correctly was also a great way to make my code more comprehensive.
