# Session 02 - Instruction (10 points)



## Task 02.01 - Coding: Circles

🔗 **Sketch:** [sparkler](https://editor.p5js.org/nikara/sketches/2a3vUgEze)

This sketch draws a group of small circles that rotate around the center of the canvas while moving smoothly in and out. Over time, more circles are added, so a new shape is visible -> a big circle made out of the little ones.

## Task 02.02 - Coding: Happiness

🔗 **Sketch:** [constellations](https://editor.p5js.org/nikara/sketches/GorkK25rp)

This sketch creates small points that appear randomly across the canvas and slowly grow in size before shrinking again, giving them a twinkling effect. Nearby points are connected with  lines, presenting shapes that look like star constellations. I associate this sketch with happiness because of my personal connection to stars and because I like how new structures can be created through simple connections between elements/ "people" in a wider sense.

## Task 02.03 - Algorithmic Thinking

In both sketches, I implemented my ideas by defining simple rules for position, growth, and movement, which are repeatedly applied over time. Algorithmic thinking is used here by structuring the behavior of many elements through loops or conditions and time-based changes instead of manually placing or animating each element. I tried to find approaches that are/seem "random" but create an overall coherent picture.

## Task 02.04 - Creative Instructions

 about emotional balance in these stressful stressful times :( 

Think about what is bothering you unconsciously at the moment. <br/>
if (you can solve it right now) solve it;<br/>
else try to forget it;<br/>
if (forgetting doesn’t work and you like to draw) make a small sketch about it;<br/>
else if (forgetting doesn’t work and you need an outside answer) call someone and tell them about it;<br/>
else if (forgetting doesn’t work and you want to reflect alone) take a notebook and write three sentences;<br/>
else cry;<br/>


## Learnings
-  I did it before with the greeting card but more clear this time: rotating objects AROUND a focus point
- using millis (real time) in p5js was new to me
- working with an array (array logic and push() function)
