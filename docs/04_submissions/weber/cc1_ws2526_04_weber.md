# Session 04 - Asynchronism / Space Again (15 points)


## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices

Reflect on your usage of resources and Machine Learning tools for coding.

- What have you used and how has it served you?
usage of resources:

Resource for p5js: p5js documentation and sketches made by others that I found online
ML tools: ChatGPT

- Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you (in case you have used any)?
- Would you be able to re-create it without any help?
- What can you recommend?
asking 
- How do you want to proceed?
<br>
<br>
-> to the most part understood what the ML tool has given me, if not, I asked to explain it precisely
-> recreate it without any help -> probably not, since I do have to look a lot of things up still (but I then could recreate it without the help of machine learning tools)

_Submission:_ Just a couple of bullet points are sufficient.

## Three.js
