 ## Learnings


For this submission I mostly got in contact with three.js, creating a 3d scene and 3d geometry objects. Most challenging was the balance between the technical difficulties and the conceptual idea. 
I found it challenging to have both in mind and had to set aside the technical aspects and focus on the creative concept at some point.
What I created in the end was an exercise for the functionality of functions and location of storing valuables.


First I wanted to "recreate" a circular - concentrated painting like the Kandinsky example, in the end I shifted a bit and chose colors that remind a bit of "Starry Night" by Van Gogh (but in an abstract way of course).
In total, I don't think I created a very creative artwork, but I stopped once I reached 5 hours of work and am content with my three.js learnings.
