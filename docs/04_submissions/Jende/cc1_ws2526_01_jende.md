## Introduction

### Task 01.02

*Think a bit about your own personal motivation to learn creative coding. What would you like to do with coding and the topics in this class? What kind of final creative coding project are you envisioning after the first session?* 

*Submission*:  
+ Since I’m a complete novice, I want to gain a better understanding of code in general and learn the basics.  

+ I want to understand the differences between programming languages, as well as their use cases.

+ Ideally, I’d like to reach a level where I can experiment with code in an artistic way, while understanding the underlying rules well enough to intentionally break them.

+ Since I’m interested in particle simulation and want to learn more about the fundamentals, I would like to build an interactive particle simulation for the web as my final submission.  
  Inspirations:  
  https://nullprogram.com/webgl-particles/  
  https://particle-love.com/

+ Therefore, I’m interested in exploring this topic in class, as well as learning about interactive web applications in general.

+ I’m also interested in website hosting.

### Task 01.03

*Find an existing creative coding project that you like. Coding needs to play a significant role for the project, also ideally it is web-based (this is not a hard requirement). Describe what you like about the project and why you think that the project represents creative coding.*

*Submission*:

+ I find this work inspirational, although it feels quite trippy and visually overwhelming for my personal taste. What I appreciate about it is the creation of a rollercoaster-like pathway that the user can explore, since the speed and direction (forward/backward) are controlled by the user. At the same time, the navigation is super intuitive and relies on “only” one button, which keeps the interaction simple and accessible.

+ For me, this is creative coding, because it creates that “How did they do it?” effect while also offering a unique experience and portfolio/promotion for the musicians, reflecting their style as the user navigates through the experience.

## Learnings

*Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?*

*Submission*: 

The most challenging thing for me in this session was(and probably for a long time will be) taking the time to focus on the basics. It’s nice that I can implement my ideas relatively quickly with the help of ChatGPT, but I found it essential to revisit the fundamentals. For example, by studying the “Coding Train”-videos or having ChatGPT walk me through every line of code, so that I truly understand what I’m doing. I would never have reached this point in such a short time without ChatGPT’s help. This, however, comes with the risk that I might not fully grasp what I’m doing and feel the urge to be able to code independently. While it’s not a surprise, it reminded me again that learning to code won’t happen quickly, rather I have to study consistently.
