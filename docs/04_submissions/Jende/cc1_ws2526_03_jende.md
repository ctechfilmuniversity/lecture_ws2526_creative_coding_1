### Task 03.03 - Your First Scene

Build a three dimensional, geometric scene. With geometric I mean that the scene should focus on abstract geometry - also think *sculptural*. Remember: exceptional creativity often emerges out of constraints and refrainment 😎. You could (but don't have to) find inspiration in the following art work. 

*Submission*: 

Abstract sculpture that randomly reshapes with every page refresh.

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

*Submission*: With this week’s project, I wanted to explore how the process of sweeping, which I know from 3D modeling, can be translated into Three.js. I found it a bit complicated and had to rethink my approach.  
I also tried to work without ChatGPT’s help and implement as much of the code as possible using my existing knowledge and the Three.js documentation. This approach worked well, except that rotating the normals along the vector turned out to be more complex than I expected, so I used ChatGPT for support.
