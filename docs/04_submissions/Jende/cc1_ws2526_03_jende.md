## Learnings

*Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?*

*Submission*: With this week’s project, I wanted to explore how the process of sweeping, which I know from 3D modeling, can be translated into Three.js. I found it a bit complicated and had to rethink my approach.  
I also tried to work without ChatGPT’s help and implement as much of the code as possible using my existing knowledge and the Three.js documentation. This approach worked well, except that rotating the normals along the vector turned out to be more complex than I expected, so I used ChatGPT for support.
