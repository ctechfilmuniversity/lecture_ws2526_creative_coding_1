### Description

In my final project, I expressed my longing for spring after a particularly icy winter. Inspired by the poem *Spring and All* by William Carlos Williams, I wanted to capture a bright, flowing sense of renewal—warm wind, sunlight, and fresh green growth.  
I chose the daffodil as my central motif because it’s a classic symbol of spring and also well suited to modeling with the point cloud system I recreated after discovering a tutorial by Kazuki Umeda, in which he demonstrates how to generate a flower using a polar coordinate system that is later converted into Cartesian coordinates. This approach also gave me the opportunity to explore particle interactions in greater depth.  
Additionally, I experimented with scrollytelling by allowing the geometry to transform across the sections. I implemented this by following a tutorial by Bruno Simon from the *Three.js Journey* course.

Answer: 4

- _What do you think about the context expansions, e.g., the brief general discussions of certain topics?_  
Answer: I don't understand the question

- _Which one was your favorite topic, which one your least favorite?_  
Answer: Favorite - Interaction with Three.js 

- _Was there a topic missing and if so which one?_
 I think it's important to talk more about working with AI and what it means to code and learn to code with it, where it could be hindering learning and where supports it. I think about that a lot.

- _Please feel free to add any feedback you want to give!_  
Thanks for the course and your patience, Jonathan!

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings of the final project and in regard to the whole course. What was challenging for you? How did you challenge yourself?

_Submission:_

One of the main challenges of this project was combining different snippets and functionalities into a cohesive, larger composition. I also wanted to explore how to better structure my code by splitting it into multiple .js files that would then be imported into a main file. Due to time constraints, I wasn’t able to implement this approach, but it’s something I plan to do in my next project.

Another significant challenge was translating the mathematical code for the flower point cloud from p5.js to three.js. This process took much longer than I expected, as understanding the underlying math was already challenging, and adapting it to a different framework added another layer of complexity, especially since I had just started learning three.js.
