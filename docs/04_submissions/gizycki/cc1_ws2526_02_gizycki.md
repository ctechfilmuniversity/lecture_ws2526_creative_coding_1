# Session 02 - Instruction (10 points)

>Please complete this session by January 21st. Since we did not cover local server setup yet, you can stop after the Completing the session should take < 5h.

>In this session we are going to think about the topic of _instructions_ and what the different forms in which instructions can be given. In terms of tech this session is about continuing programming with p5 and getting some coding done!

### Tools and Environments

>Are there any languages, tools or environments for creative coding that you know of, that you can recommend, and which are not included in the script? _If not, you can skip this question._

>_Submission_: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.

## Instructions

>Submit a text-based program and its result for each of the following instruction. Try to include into the programming some algorithmic thinking, meaning a structured approach.

>_Note_: You are free to choose any programming language, environment, library, etc. for this task, but it must be text-based programming. If you are a beginner, I highly recommend that you stick with p5.

>_Submission_: Submit a link to your online sketch within the p5 editor, and link in your markdown submission file at least one result image or video of your work. If you do not use the online editor, submit all source files and resources that I need to run your sketch.

### Task 02.01 - _Coding_

### Task 02.03 - _Algorithmic Thinking_

>Briefly reflect on how you implemented your creative idea. Did you apply algorithmic thinking and if so, how?

>_Submission_: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.

- I translated my idea of happiness into simple visual rules.
- The mouse position controls the position of a sun.
- A loop is used to draw evenly distributed sun rays around the sun.
- Each mouse click creates a heart at the current position.
- The hearts are stored in a list and redrawn every frame.
- This structured approach allowed me to build the visual step by step using algorithmic thinking.


### Task 02.04 - _Creative Instructions_

>Write instructions that are in themselves a creative output.

>_Hint:_ This is not about instructions for a creative output but about thinking about the instructions themselves and how to shape them creatively.

>_Submission_: Text and/or an audiovisual representation in your markdown submission file.

Instructions from Buff Hase 🐰
1. Stare at the sun ☀ and try flexing your arm muscles. 
2. Each blink grows your ♥-muscles a little more.
3. Leap three times to the left ← ← ←  and scatter some sweat drops 💦. 
4. Admire the sparkling reflections of the sun ✨.
5. Repeat until your face is smiling like the sun ☀.
6. Buff Hase is always watching. Make him proud 💪.

### We will get to [Script 06 - The Web](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_06_web_script.md) at a later class, so you're not expected to know / do this part until after the break.

## The Web

### Task 02.05 - _Working With a Local Server_

Create a setup with a local webserver and be able to work with, e.g., p5, locally.

A possible setup could simply be using a local webserver with [the VSCode extension](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#webservers).

If needed, re-cap the topic by reading [Example: A Local Setup For p5.js](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#example-a-local-setup-for-p5js).

Also, it is time to getting used to doing simple steps with the terminal (😱). For that, you can work through the chapter [Terminal / Console](..//02_scripts/cc1_ws2425_02_setup_script.md#terminal--console) in the setup script.

No need to submit anything, but I expect that you are ready to work with a local webserver and the terminal from next week on.
