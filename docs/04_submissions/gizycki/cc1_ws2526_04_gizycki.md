# Session 04 - Asynchronism / Space Again (15 points)

Please complete this session by February 11th. Completing the session should take < 6h.

- [Creative Coding I](#creative-coding-i)
- [Session 04 - Asynchronism / Space Again (15 points)](#session-04---asynchronism--space-again-15-points)
  - [JavaScript Functions \& Asynchronism](#javascript-functions--asynchronism)
    - [Task 04.01](#task-0401)
    - [Task 04.02 - Coding Practices](#task-0402---coding-practices)
  - [Three.js](#threejs)
    - [Task 04.03 - Your Own Scene](#task-0403---your-own-scene)
  - [Learnings](#learnings)

In this session we are dealing with the topic of _asynchronism_, where we encounter it in every day life and what it means for us as humans. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to some web-specific JavaScript functionality and syntax, which we will need in the upcoming sessions.

## JavaScript Functions & Asynchronism

### Task 04.01

Re-cap the sections in the script regarding higher order functions and their different syntax formats. As a beginner you can skip the more advanced sections that we haven't covered in class:

- [Higher Order Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#higher-order-functions)
- [Anonymous Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#anonymous-functions)
- [Arrow Functions](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#arrow-functions)
- [Asynchronism](../../02_scripts/cc1_ws2526_04_javascript_script.md#asynchronism)

At the very least make sure that you understand the underlying functionality and that you will be able to work with the syntax when given to you, e.g., from a framework.

If you are more advanced, make sure that your understand Closures, Promises and Async and Await.

_Submission:_ ✅

### Task 04.02 - Coding Practices

Reflect on your usage of resources and Machine Learning tools for coding.

- *What have you used and how has it served you?*
  - I used Claude/Gemini/ChatGPT for my homework. I often switched between these different models because some were better suited to certain queries than others. So I never actually wrote code using only one AI. For reviewing and memorizing the content, I used NotebookLM, among other things. I learned the most when I tackled the visual aesthetics and modified the code until I really liked the output. The AI ​​sometimes gave me very strange advice regarding the visual output, which I then ignored. This led me to modify the code itself a lot and gradually understand the architecture and functions. Of course, I also learned a lot from error messages. I essentially needed the AI ​​for the technical aspects and learned quite a lot without much effort. I always have the code explained to me and write down lots of notes.
- *Do you actually understand the code an ML tool has given to you (in case you have used any)?*
  - The AI ​​helped me understand code and find errors. Sometimes I still don't fully understand the code.
- *Would you be able to re-create it without any help?*
  - Without help, I couldn't yet recreate the code on my own.
- *What can you recommend?*
  - I want to practice more so I can write code more independently. I have the impression that if I do right in the beginning some hard tasks I learn a lot just by trying to do them.
- "How do you want to proceed?"
  - I just want to keep going like this. I've noticed that I'm already writing small parts of the code myself, simply because I know how the structure is. That's pretty amazing for me because at the beginning I didn't understand any of the coding languages ​​at all. I'll soon be taking the Three.js course we bought, and that will help me solidify some of the basics. Right now, I'm trying to fix errors myself, as far as I understand them. I think if I continue like this, I'll soon be able to do less with AI and more writing myself.

_Submission:_ ✅

## Three.js

### Task 04.03 - Your Own Scene

Create a Three.js scene up to your liking. There are no constraints for what the scene should be. The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

You are required to use additional functionality that you haven't yet used last week. Check the [three.js manual](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene) or [the examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_animation_keyframes) for inspiration.

_Submission_: Link in your markdown submission file at least one result image or video of your work. Also, submit the required source files, and your package.json for me to `npm install` and `npm run` your project. If your are using a different environment than npm, let me know which steps to follow and make sure that the required steps to run your project are **easy** and **fast** (make it easy on other developers to run your code, it will make their life easier and they will be more likely to help you).

## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings. What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?

_Submission_: Text or bullet points in your markdown submission file.
